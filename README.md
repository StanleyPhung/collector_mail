# automatos: A T3 Stack Project

## Overview

This automatos project, bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`, is a full-stack application built with Next.js, NextAuth.js, Prisma, Drizzle, Tailwind CSS, and tRPC. The project aims to provide a simple and efficient starting point for developers to build web applications using these popular technologies. For some demonstration, this is the link to the video I'll show: https://drive.google.com/file/d/18anvqqpITDIef4iwNwb3_Lq1hz1W-qd4/view?usp=sharing

## Key Components

- Next.js: A React framework for server-side rendering, code splitting, and other performance optimizations.
- NextAuth.js: An authentication library for Next.js that provides flexible and secure user authentication.
- Prisma: An open-source ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) that provides a type-safe and efficient way to interact with the database.
- Drizzle: A state management library for React applications that simplifies the management of global application state.
- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework that provides a wide range of pre-built CSS classes to help developers build responsive and customizable user interfaces.
- tRPC: A type-safe remote procedure call (RPC) framework for TypeScript that provides a convenient and efficient way to handle data fetching and communication between the frontend and backend.

## Key Features

- User authentication using NextAuth.js and multiple authentication providers (e.g., OAuth, email/password).
- Database interactions using Prisma ORM, allowing developers to query and manipulate data in a type-safe manner.
- Global state management using Drizzle, simplifying the management of application state and providing a centralized store for data.
- Responsive and customizable user interfaces using Tailwind CSS, eliminating the need for writing custom CSS.
- Data fetching and communication between the frontend and backend using tRPC, ensuring type safety and reducing the likelihood of errors.

## Getting Started

1. Refer to the [T3 Stack documentation](https://t3docs.com/) for detailed guides and tutorials.
2. Follow the deployment guides for [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), or [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to deploy your project.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized into several key directories:

- `src`: Contains the main source code for the application.
- `prisma`: Contains the database schema and migration files, using the Prisma ORM for database interactions.
- `public`: Contains static assets, such as the `favicon.ico` file.
- `server`: Contains server-side code, including database and API-related files.

## Contributing

Welcome feedback and contributions to the `create-t3-app` GitHub repository. Feel free to open issues, submit pull requests, or contribute to the project in any way you see fit.
